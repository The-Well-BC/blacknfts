## Artist CSVs

Open a csv file in LibreOffice/OpenOffice calc, Excel, or Google sheets. Update the artist information and upload back here with the same filename and updates should be made to the website in a few minutes.

- artistProfiles.csv is for the artists on the 'Artist List' page
- artists-(Foundation|Rarible|Zora|SuperRare).csv is used to load a random artist on the home page.
